                Since Iâ€™ve stoped competing the summer is the season that I
                consider the height of my training year. For me itâ€™s the
                ultimate test of how well the year of hard training has turned
                out as a whole. It is the time of the year when you find
                yourself going to the beach and pool on hols and being in a
                position where you have little choice but to reveal what kind of
                physique you posses in publicðŸ¤”

                Everyone who enters the physique industry with the goal to
                compete holds the vision of winning. If this were not true then
                you would not go through the grueling process that is required
                of competitive physique athletes to win your class or overall
                championship. However, many athletes fall short of ever winning
                their dreams because of one particular shortfallâ€¦ they stop at
                the point of being good when they should press onward to being
                great.

                Bertil was one of the most popular bodybuilders of that time. He
                was very much ahead of his time in terms of displaying the
                muscle mass and conditioning youâ€™d see on todayâ€™s pros. Have a
                look at his posing routine from the 1983 Mr Olympia and listen
                to the crowd's response to his massive presence on the stage,
                it's definitely worth a look, you can find it on YouTube.
