              <p>
                Very sad news…I knew Blue as we grew up around the corner from
                each other. I met him most days in the gym and the last time we
                spoke was yesterday. We talked about old times, the sport as it
                is now and training and life in general. One of the last things
                he said in that conversation was to a young Bodybuilder who came
                into the changing rooms giving him some good advice as always.
